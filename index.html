const text = `Im really grateful to start this year with you. You’ve already become so important to me and Im excited to see where this year takes us. Im really glad its you.

I dont really know how to explain it but with you, everything I was never sure about with anyone else just started to make sense. It’s only been a month and yet you’ve already become such an important part of my life. In such a short time you’ve made me smile more and feel happier in ways I honestly didn’t expect.
I know choosing you so quickly was a big decision for me. It’s not something I usually do and I did question myself at times, wondering if I was doing the right thing. But the day I got to know your standards, I realized how serious you are about the person you choose and in that moment I knew I wanted to be that person for you.
What I love most is how easy everything feels with you. There’s no pressure and no pretending, just comfort and understanding. I catch myself thinking about you randomly during the day, smiling for no reason, and that’s when I realize how much you’ve slowly started to mean to me.
I know it’s only been a month, and I don’t know you completely yet but I want to. I want to know the real you. I want to understand you and learn the way you want to be loved. The closer I get to you the more I find myself liking you and that feeling just keeps growing.
I don’t want you to be perfect. I just want you to be you the real and genuine you especially when you’re with me. And I know I annoy you sometimes… I honestly just find it cute to annoy you. I’m really sorry if I’ve ever annoyed you too much.

I love you so much and I honestly can’t put it into words. All I know is that I want you and only you.`;
